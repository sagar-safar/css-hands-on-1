    <h2><i>What is CSS?</i></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
        <li> <span class="first-part">Css is not neccessary</span> <span class="second-part">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li class="item"><i>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</i></li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2><i>CSS can be added to HTML documnets in 3 ways:</i></h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal-by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to  to keep the styles in external CSS files.However, in this <br>
       <span class="third-part"> tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier <br>
         for you to try it yourself</li>
        
    </ul>

    
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also <br> special in that you can use special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the <br> element.</p>


    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
